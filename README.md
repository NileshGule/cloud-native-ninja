This repository is the playground for the Cloud Native Ninja YouTube series. The assumption is that the person going through this series is an absolute beginner to cloud native technologies. The goal is to provide a hands-on experience with the technologies and concepts that are covered in the series. The series is broken up into multiple parts:

- Developer machine setup

    - Install required tools and setup a developer machine
        - [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)

        - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 
        - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
        - [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and many more

    

- Application development - Polyglot application development with front end, middle tier, and back end developed using different languages and frameworks
    - Programming languages and SDKs

        - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
        - [ReactJS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-reactjs-on-windows/)
- Containerization 
    - run containerized applications like databases, message brokers, and more

Note: The objective of this series is to provide a hands-on experience with the technologies and concepts that are covered in the series. The goal is not to provide a deep dive into the technologies and concepts. 

It is difficult for one person to cover all the topics in the series. Therefore, I am looking for contributors to help with the series. If you are interested in contributing to the series, please reach out to me on Twitter @nileshgule.

This repository is a work in progress. I will be adding more content to the repository as I progress through the series. You can contribute to this work by submitting a pull request. I will be more than happy to host you on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJOvQz55Ly-Rkr_ldE8pMEQ) as a guest to talk about the contribution you made to the series.
